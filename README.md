# Lachsam Labs Storefront

This repository contains the static storefront for **Lachsam Labs**, featuring a dark-themed design, product listings, and cryptocurrency/Telegram order options.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. **GitHub Repository**: Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `lachsamlabs-store`) and add the site files (HTML, CSS, images) to the repository.
2. **Publish via GitHub Pages**: In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages. Select the **main branch** (or `gh-pages` branch) as the source for GitHub Pages. Once enabled, GitHub Pages will provide a live URL (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`).
3. **Custom Domain (Optional)**: If you have a custom domain (e.g., `growthprotocols.com` or `lachsamlabs.com`), update the DNS records to point to GitHub Pages and add the domain in the repository's Pages settings.

After publishing, you should be able to visit the live preview of the site via the GitHub Pages URL. This link is stable and can be shared with users for a live preview of the store.
